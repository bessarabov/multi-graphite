The recommended way to run this project is to use docker.

Run the command:

```
docker run --detach --publish 8000:80 --name multi-graphite bessarabov/multi-graphite:1.1.0

This command will download the needed docker image and run it.

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

To stop it run the command:

```
docker rm -f multi-graphite
```

opened graphiteÂ url to multi-graphite url.

Use the code from the file `bookmark.js`, but change
"http://localhost:8000" in the code to the address of your
installation of multi-graphite.
